# Radio Kids



## Development

### Dependencies:
- p5.js
- p5.sound.js
- jQuery  
  
All the dependencies already come with the repository (in `./public` folder). Just clone it and run `main.py` :


```bash
# Clone repo
git clone <repo>

# Start local server
python3 main.py # prints localhost:<port> to console

# The application is now running and can be accessed at localhost:<port>
```
